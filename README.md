# Doodle-Jump
This game is built using HTML5 Canvas Element and Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

It makes use of concepts like infinite scrolling of game objects and background. The game gets more difficult to play with the increase in score value. Also uploaded its tutorial on my youTube channel
